publishedAt: 5 Nov 2022
description: You can customise the website to fit your needs by editing a few config files.

#### Table of Contents

## YAML Content
### Settings
Site settings can be edited in `content/settings.yaml`. You can edit the tile and links displayed from the front page here.

### About
An optional about page can be generated by having a `content/about.yaml`. You can add a short bio and sections to generate a page that resembled a CV or resume. There is more information at [/about](/about). If you don't need this, you can simply delete the file.

## Theme
Since this project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) you can edit  `tailwind.config.cjs` to customise the theme of this site. Editing the primary and secondary list of colours will change the theme of the majority of the site.

## Site Config
Other configuration settings are available at `$lib/config.ts`, this changes how the site behaves and the variables are shown below. For example, you can change how many posts are shown in each page, how tolerant the fuzzy search is, or what the threshold of overlapping keywords is for related posts.

```js
// How many posts to display in the post list
const postsPerPage = 5;
// How many other related posts to link to from a post
const maxRelatedPosts = 3;
// The minimum proportion or keywords that overlap with another post to be considered related
const relatedPostThreshold = 0.05;
// The maximum distance between the search term and post property
const searchResultTolerance = 2;
// The GitHub user for this repository
const githubUser = 'paullj';
// The repository name
const githubRepo = 'paullj.github.io';
```
